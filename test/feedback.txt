Overall, the code appears to be well-structured and readable. However, there are a few potential areas for improvement:

Type Annotations: While the code uses type annotations, some of them are not consistent. For example, the type of constraints is sometimes annotated as Optional[Dict] and sometimes as Dict. It would be good to use consistent type annotations throughout the codebase.

Documentation: The code could benefit from more extensive documentation, particularly in the form of docstrings. Docstrings help to clarify the purpose and expected usage of functions, methods, and classes, making it easier for others to use and understand the code.

Testing: It is important to thoroughly test code to ensure that it functions correctly under different conditions. While the code appears to be implemented correctly, it would be beneficial to include more tests to validate that the code is working as intended.

Error Handling: While the code handles some errors, there may be cases where it does not gracefully handle unexpected inputs or errors. It would be helpful to add more robust error handling to prevent the code from crashing or producing unexpected results.

Separation of Concerns: In some cases, the code mixes concerns, such as including optimization logic in the pipeline code. It would be good to separate concerns more clearly so that each module is responsible for a single task.

Configurability: Some of the code is hard-coded, making it difficult to customize or reuse for different scenarios. It would be beneficial to make the code more configurable and modular, so that it can be adapted to different use cases.

Overall, the code appears to be well-implemented and functional, but could benefit from improvements in terms of consistency, documentation, testing, error handling, separation of concerns, and configurability.
